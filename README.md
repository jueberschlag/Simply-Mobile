# Introduction

Our mobile development framework relies on Appcelerator technology to allow you to develop an iPhone / Android native mobile application quickly and easily without writting any code.
All you have to provide is a configuration file containing information about your app such as the url from where to fetch data (if you want to have data-binding), the different windows of your application and interactions between windows.
Currently the part that generate the code for a module which can be included in an existing Appcelerator project is in beta-version and almost ready for a release.
The part that generate the whole application is in alpha version for the moment.

#Â Getting Started  
To use this framework, you will have to fork the repository or dowload the code.
We are using Node.js with some modules like express and ejs to generated the code. Here is a list of module that you will have to install:

- express
- ejs
- native-zip

Once you have the code on your computer, you can generate the code by calling our template with your configuration file.
Here is how to do it with

<pre>
var express = require('express');

var app = express.createServer(express.logger());
var fs = require('fs');
var ejs = require('ejs');
var Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer;
var nativeZip = require("node-native-zip");
 
//return the code for a module
app.get('/generateModuleCode', function(request, response) {
	var confFile = fs.readFileSync('apps/yourApplication/conf.json');
	var confFileParse = JSON.parse(confFile);
	var template = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/baseTemplate.ejs', 'utf8');
	response.end(ejs.render(template, {module : confFileParse, ejs : ejs, fs : fs}));
});

//return a zip file containing all the application
app.get('/generateApplication', function(request, response) {
    //Read / parse all conf files
    var appFile = fs.readFileSync('apps/test/app.json');
    var jsonAppParse = JSON.parse(appFile);
    var confFile = fs.readFileSync('apps/test/conf.json');
    var jsonConfParse = JSON.parse(confFile);

    // Read all template files
    var tiappTemplate = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/tiappTemplate.ejs', 'utf8');
    var baseTemplate = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/baseTemplate.ejs', 'utf8');
    var appTemplate = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/appTemplate.ejs', 'utf8');

    // Create all the template results
    var tiappResult = ejs.render(tiappTemplate, {app : jsonAppParse, ejs : ejs, fs : fs}); 
    var baseResult = ejs.render(baseTemplate, {module : jsonConfParse, ejs : ejs, fs : fs}); 
    var appResult = ejs.render(appTemplate, {app : jsonAppParse, ejs : ejs, fs : fs}); 

    // Read all lib files
    var backboneCollectionBinder = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/Backbone.CollectionBinder.Ti.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneCollectionUpdate = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/Backbone.CollectionUpdate.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneDeepModel = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/Backbone.DeepModel.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneModelBinder = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/Backbone.ModelBinder.Ti.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneSync = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/Backbone.Sync.Ti.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneFile = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/backbone.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneSubset = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/backbone.subset.js', 'utf8');
    var backboneUtils = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/Backbone.Utils.js', 'utf8');
    var sjclFile = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/sjcl.js', 'utf8');
    var underscoreFile = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/underscore.js', 'utf8');
    var utilsFile = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/utils.js', 'utf8');
    var dataManagementFile = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/dataManagement.js', 'utf8');
    var loaderFile = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/lib/loader.js', 'utf8');
    //Images
    var spinnerImage = fs.readFileSync('Resources/template/images/spinner.png');
    if (jsonAppParse.icon) {
        var appIcon = fs.readFileSync('apps/' + jsonConfParse.moduleName + '/images/' + jsonAppParse.icon);
    }
    if (jsonAppParse.splashScreen) {
        var splashScreen = fs.readFileSync('apps/' + jsonConfParse.moduleName + '/images/' + jsonAppParse.splashScreen);
    }

    var downloadZip = new nativeZip();
    downloadZip.add("tiapp.xml", new Buffer(tiappResult));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/app.js", new Buffer(appResult));
    //controller files
    downloadZip.add("Resources/controller/dataManagement.js" , new Buffer(dataManagementFile));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/controller/loader.js" , new Buffer(loaderFile));

    if (jsonAppParse.icon) {
        downloadZip.add("Resources/android/" + jsonAppParse.icon, new Buffer(appIcon));
        downloadZip.add("Resources/iphone/" + jsonAppParse.icon, new Buffer(appIcon));
    }
    if (jsonAppParse.splashScreen) {
        downloadZip.add("Resources/android/default.png", new Buffer(splashScreen));
        downloadZip.add("Resources/iphone/Default.png", new Buffer(splashScreen));
    }
    //lib files
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/Backbone.CollectionBinder.Ti.js" , new Buffer(backboneCollectionBinder));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/Backbone.CollectionUpdate.js" , new Buffer(backboneCollectionUpdate));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/Backbone.DeepModel.js" , new Buffer(backboneDeepModel));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/Backbone.Utils.js" , new Buffer(backboneUtils));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/Backbone.ModelBinder.Ti.js" , new Buffer(backboneModelBinder));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/Backbone.Sync.Ti.js" , new Buffer(backboneSync));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/backbone.js" , new Buffer(backboneFile));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/backbone.subset.js" , new Buffer(backboneSubset));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/sjcl.js" , new Buffer(sjclFile));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/lib/underscore.js" , new Buffer(underscoreFile));
    downloadZip.add("Resources/utils.js" , new Buffer(utilsFile));
    //ui files
    downloadZip.add("Resources/ui/" + jsonConfParse.moduleName + '.js', new Buffer(baseResult));
    //images folder
    downloadZip.add("Resources/images/spinner.png", new Buffer(spinnerImage));

    response.send(downloadZip.toBuffer());
});

</pre>

Here is how your folder structure should look:  

<pre>
- Resources
	- template
		- ui
        - lib
        - images
- apps
	- yourApplicationName
        - app.json
		- conf.json
		- styleSheet.json
		- images
			icon.png
			splashScreen.png
</pre>

# Application File  

This file is the entry configuration file of your application.  
It will be used with a configuration file to create an iPhone / Android mobile application.
Here is a list of attributes that you can put in this file:

- "allowHorizontal" : unused for now. Will contain a boolean to allow or not the landscape mode (optional, default to true)
- "baseFile" : string that contain the name of the module in conf.json (required)

Once you have written your application and your configuration files you can use the code in the Getting Started part to download the zip file containing your application files. To build your application you will have to use Appcelerator Studio and import a project from an existing folder (File -> Import -> Existing folder as a new project). Remeber to check "Titanium Mobile" in the check-list.  
We are currently working on a script to avoid the import in Titanium studio to build your application.


# Configuration File  

The entry point of your module is the main configuration file which will be named here conf.json.  
The framework use the configuration file to generate Appcelerator code. We remember you that this file is used to generate the code for a module which will be integrated in an existing Appcelerator project. To load the generated code you could just use Ti.App and fire the event "loadModuleName" where ModuleName should be replaced by the name of your module. To open the main window of the module, you could use Ti.App and fire the event "loadModuleName".  
Here is a list of attributes that you can put in this file:

- "moduleName": string that contains the name of the module (required). This name has to be the name of the module folder in the apps folder.

			}
		}
	</pre>
	<pre>
   		action : {

			"successAttribute" : "success" //name of the successAttribute. This attribute has to be in the data attribute of the server's response
			"successEvent" :  "serverResonse" //name of the event that will be listened for the server response. When the mobile receive the response from the server it will fire an event with the name contain in the event attribute of the server's response. Default to "<%- parentName %>SendDataResponse" where parentName is the name of the current view
			"onSuccess" : "alert('success');" //code to execute when success (optional)
			"onFailure" : "alert('error');" //code to execute when failure (optional)
		} // you can also sendData from the server to the mobile with the data attribute of the server's response
		/*
		The response from the server could look like this
		response = {
			"event" : "successEvent",
			"data" : {
				"success" : true,
				"payLoad" : "response"
			}
		}
		*/
	</pre>
- "newModel": list of objects to describe the location of attribute when you want to create a new model. It is composed of 2 attributes:
  - "modelAttribute": name of the attribute in the model you want to create
  - "objectAttribute": name of the attribute in the current component. For example if you want to get the value from a "TextField" component then the value of this attribute will be "value"
- "params": object that has this template:
	<pre>
		{
			"attributeName" : {
				"type" : "calculatedValue",
				"valueType": "String",
				"parameters" : {
					"startDate" : {
						"type" : "attributeValue",
						"valueType" : "String",
						"value" : "startDate"
					}
				},
				"value": "return startDate"
			}
		}
	</pre>
  - "type" can be either "directValue" (attributeName will then be equal to the "value" attribute), attributeValue (attributeName will then be equal to the "value" attribute of the current model) or calculatedValue (attributeName will then be equal to the result of the function where "value" is the body and parameters are the arguments).
  - "valueType" describe the type of attributeName. It can be "String", "Int", "Direct" or "loadPath" when it is an image that is fetched locally or from a server
  - "parameters" is an object of arguments for then function when "type" is equal to "calculatedValue"
  - "value" is the value of attributeName when "type" is equal to "directValue", the model's attribute name when "type" is equal to "attributeValue" or the body of the function when "type" is equal to "calculatedValue". For "directValue" or "attributeValue" you can specify differents values base on the platform. Here is a way to do it:
  		<pre>
			{
				"def" : 15,
				"android" : 13,
				"iphone" : 12,
				"ipad" : 25 
			}
		</pre>
  - "attributeName" can be a custom attribute or any attribute from a component like height or layout (see Appcelerator documentation).
- "item": string that contains the name of the item that will repeated for each model in the linked collection (optional)
- "searchable": if View or TableView with "item" attribute then this attribute is a boolean to show or hide the searchbar (optional, false by default). If inside an item (View or TableViewRow) then it is a list of model attributes that will be used to search results in the parent component which is a View or a TableView (optional) 
- "dependencies": list of files that will be included before include the current file (optional, will be use only when current view is included from a require)

#Â Demonstration  

For now there is only one demo app but we are currently working on adding 2 or 3 more.
In the Demonstration folder you can find one folder per demo application. These applications are here to show you how to use the framework and how you can use each attributes of the framework.
On each folder there are tow sub-folders. The first one is the configuration folder (which contain app.json, conf.json and some other usefull files) and the second one is the folder that contain the source code generated with the configuration files. There is also a web.js file containing an example of server-side code.
For each demo application you can copy-paste the configuration folder on your Node.js server with a folder-structure as shown on the "Getting started" part.
There are two demo app right now :
- the "test" app is an application that allows you to validate / reject some contracts. It shows you how to create subset of collections and use them in differents tabs
- the "RSS Reader" app is an application that allow you to add a rss source from your mobile and then fetch them to have a list of rss feeds on your phone. It shows you the creation, the modification and the deletion of a model. It is a good example of how to fetch information from different sources (google website, blogs, professional webservices like SAP webservices, ...).
The next demo application will be an application with login possibilities to have custom informations in your application. We will build a demo application with private chat rooms and someting like that. This application will also show the notifications possibilites since this feature is currently on development.

#Â Test  

We are currently working on a way to test the framework automatically.

#Â Roadmap / TODO

Better performance on close of "big" windows (windows that contain lots of rows created from a model)
Notifications possibilities
Script to build the app without Titanium Studio
Script to check the entry file (app.json and conf.json) before app generation
Analytics possibilities
